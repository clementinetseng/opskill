# Regulation & Compliance (PAGCOR)

> **💡 中文摘要 (Chinese Summary)**
> * **監管機構**：**PAGCOR** 是核心監管者，同時擁有「營運」與「監管」雙重身份（正計畫私有化以分離職權）。
> * **市場區隔**：
>     * **Onshore (境內)**：透過 PIGO 架構合法對菲律賓人開放 (如 BingoPlus)，需有實體場館連結。
>     * **Offshore (境外)**：即 POGO (現稱 IGL)，嚴禁對菲律賓本地人開放，且正在面臨政府全面淘汰的政策轉向。
> * **紅線警告**：E-sabong (線上鬥雞) 因社會問題已被全面禁止，切勿觸碰。

## 1. Regulatory Authority: PAGCOR
**PAGCOR** (Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation) regulates all gaming activities.
* **Dual Role**: Historically an operator and regulator. Plans are underway to privatize casinos by 2025 to become a pure regulator.
* **Revenue Goal**: Mandated to generate funds for nation-building.

## 2. Licensing Frameworks
It is vital to distinguish between Domestic and Offshore licenses.

### A. Onshore (Domestic) - PIGO
* **Target**: Filipino residents (21+ years old).
* **Origin**: "Philippine Inland Gaming Operator" (PIGO) scheme launched in late 2020.
* **Requirement**: Online operations must often be tied to a physical gaming license (e.g., a casino or bingo hall).
* **Examples**: BingoPlus, Solaire Online.

### B. Offshore (International) - POGO / IGL
* **Target**: **Foreigners only**. Strictly prohibited from accepting Filipino players.
* **Status**: Formerly "POGO", rebranded to "Internet Gaming License" (IGL).
* **Policy Shift**: As of late 2023/2024, the government is moving to **phase out** offshore operators due to crime/reputational risks.

* Self-exclusion registries.
* Potential bans on influencer marketing for gambling.
